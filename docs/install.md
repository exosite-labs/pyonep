Installation
------------

Install from Python package index:

```bash

    $ pip install pyonep
```

Or install from source:

```bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/exosite-labs/pyonep
    $ cd pyonep
    $ python setup.py install
```

If you'd rather not install the package, you can also copy the
`./pyonep/pyonep` folder into the same folder as your script, or
add the `./pyonep/pyonep` folder to your sys.path.

If you're running a version of Python earlier than 2.6 you'll need the
`python-simplejson` package, [available here](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/)

Now that you've got pyonep installed, you'll probably want to [get a CIK](getcik.html) so
you can start using ONE Platform. Or maybe you've already got a CIK and you wanna look
at some [examples](examples.html).
