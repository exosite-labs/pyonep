Examples
========

Here are some examples of how to use pyonep. For more detailed documentation of the Exosite
APIs, you might want to check out [Exosite's RPC API documentation](https://github.com/exosite/docs/tree/master/rpc)
and [Exosite's Provisioning/Device Management API documentation](https://github.com/exosite/docs/tree/master/provision).

Create a test child and then list the root

    >>> from pyonep import onep; from test import test_base
    >>> client = test_base.create_temporary_client()
    >>> o = onep.OnepV1()
    >>> desc = {'format': 'string', 'retention': {'count': 'infinity', 'duration': 'infinity'}}
    >>> isok, rid = o.createDataport(client.cik, desc)
    >>> isok, len(rid)
    (True, 40)
    >>> isok, listing = o.listing(client.cik, ['client', 'dataport'], {}, {'alias': ''})
    >>> isok
    True
    >>> len(listing['client']), len(listing['dataport'])
    (0, 1)


More examples are located in [examples/](examples). To run them, first modify them with your
device information.

* [read_write_direct.py](https://github.com/exosite-labs/pyonep/blob/master/examples/read_write_direct.py) - writes to a resource and then reads back
* [get_info.py](https://github.com/exosite-labs/pyonep/blob/master/examples/get_info.py) - gets information about a client, and demonstrates error handling
* [mult_cmd.py](https://github.com/exosite-labs/pyonep/blob/master/examples/mult_cmd.py) - uses the onep module to send
* [provisioning.py](https://github.com/exosite-labs/pyonep/blob/master/examples/provisioning.py) - demonstrates use of the provisioning API

Note that to run the examples without installing the pyonep package, the
example script must be located in the root folder (with `./pyonep` as a
sub-folder).

For a Python example that fully exercises the RPC interface using the pyonep
library, see the Exosite command line interface, [exoline](http://github.com/exosite/exoline).
