Getting A CIK
-------------

Access to the Exosite API requires a Client Identification Key (CIK).
If you're just getting started with the API and have signed up with a
community portal, here's how you can find a CIK:

1. Log in to [Exosite Portals](https://portals.exosite.com)
2. Click on "devices" on the menu on the left
3. Click on a device to open its properties
4. The device's CIK is displayed on the left

Once you have a CIK, you can substitute it in the examples below. Note that any functions that take a parameter called `auth` can take a string CIK directly, or you can pass an auth dictionary as described [here](http://docs.exosite.com/rpc/#authentication).

Now that you've got a CIK, you can start using Exosite's APIs. Why not check out some of our [examples](examples.html) if you're looking for a starting place?
